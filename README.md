# Simple Genetic Algorithm Implementation to solve the **Travelling Salesman Probelm**

This was a project for my *Combinatorial Optimization* course.

I did a very simple implementation. The time I had to perform the project was not enough to play a bit with different operators and different strategies.
The implementation is mostly procedural, just implemented a Weighted Graph data structure that would be useful.

Besides the code, I also provide the project report in Portuguese, a notebook with the implementation and an R script using the `library(TSP)` which I used to check how bad/good my implementation was.
